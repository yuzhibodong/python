The SGE Game Engine ("SGE", pronounced like "Sage") is a general-purpose
2-D game engine.  It takes care of several details for you so you can
focus on the game itself.  This makes more rapid game development
possible, and it also makes the SGE easy to learn.

The SGE is `free/libre software
<http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>`_, and the SGE documentation is
free/libre as well.

Although it isn't required, you are encouraged to release your games'
code under a free/libre software license, such as the GNU General Public
License, the Expat License, or the Apache License.  Doing so is easy,
does not negatively affect you, and is highly appreciated as a
contribution to a free society.

SGE Concepts
============

Events
------

The SGE uses an event-based system.  When an event occurs, a certain
event method (with a name that begins with ``event_``) is called. To
define actions triggered by events, simply override the appropriate
event method.

At a lower level, it is possible to read "input events" from
:attr:`sge.game.input_events` and handle them manually.  See the
documentation for :mod:`sge.input` for more information.  This is not
recommended, however, unless you are running your own loop for some
reason (in which case it is necessary to do this in order to get input
from the user).

Position
--------

In all cases of positioning for the SGE, it is based on a
two-dimensional graph with each unit being a pixel.  This graph is not
quite like regular graphs.  The horizontal direction, normally called
``x``, is the same as the x-axis on a regular graph; ``0`` is the
origin, positive numbers are to the right of the origin, and negative
numbers are to the left of the origin.  However, in the vertical
direction, normally called ``y``, ``0`` is the origin, positive numbers
are below the origin, and negative numbers are above the origin.  While
slightly jarring if you are used to normal graphs, this is in fact
common in 2-D game development and is also how pixels in most image
formats are indexed.

Except where otherwise specified, the origin is always located at the
top-leftmost position of an object.

In addition to integers, position variables are allowed by the SGE to be
floating-point numbers.

Z-Axis
------

The SGE uses a Z-axis to determine where objects are placed in the third
dimension.  Objects with a higher Z value are considered to be closer to
the viewer and thus will be placed over objects which have a lower Z
value.  Note that the Z-axis does not allow 3-D gameplay or effects; it
is only used to tell the SGE what to do with objects that overlap.  For
example, if an object called ``spam`` has a Z value of ``5`` while an
object called ``eggs`` has a Z value of ``2``, ``spam`` will obscure
part or all of ``eggs`` when the two objects overlap.

If two objects with the same Z-axis value overlap, the object which was
most recently added to the room is placed in front.

The Game Loop
-------------

There can occasionally be times where you want to run your own loop,
independent of the SGE's main loop.  This is not recommended in general,
but if you must (to freeze the game, for example), you should know the
general game loop structure::

    while True:
        # Input events
        sge.game.pump_input()
        while sge.game.input_events:
            event = sge.game.input_events.pop(0)

            # Handle event

        # Regulate speed
        time_passed = sge.game.regulate_speed()

        # Logic (e.g. collision detection and step events)

        # Refresh
        sge.game.refresh()

:meth:`sge.Game.pump_input` should be called every frame regardless of
whether or not user input is needed.  Failing to call it will cause the
queue to build up, but more importantly, the OS may decide that the
program has locked up if it doesn't get a response for a long time.

:meth:`sge.Game.regulate_speed` limits the frame rate of the game and
tells you how much time has passed since the last frame.  It is not
technically necessary, but using it is highly recommended; otherwise,
the CPU will be working harder than it needs to and if things are
moving, their speed will be irregular.

:meth:`sge.Game.refresh` is necessary for any changes to the screen to
be seen by the user.  This includes new objects, removed objects, new
projections, discontinued projections, etc.

Dependencies
------------

- Python 2 (2.7 or later) or 3 (3.1 or later) <http://www.python.org>
- Pygame 1.9.1 or later <http://pygame.org>

Formats Support
---------------

:class:`sge.Sprite` supports the following image formats:

- PNG
- JPEG
- Non-animated GIF
- BMP
- PCX
- Uncompressed Truevision TGA
- TIFF
- ILBM
- Netpbm
- X Pixmap

:class:`sge.Sound` supports the following audio formats:

- Uncompressed WAV
- Ogg Vorbis

:class:`sge.Music` supports the following audio formats:

- Ogg Vorbis
- MP3 (support limited; use not recommended)
- MOD
- XM
- MIDI

For starting position in MOD files, the pattern order number is used
instead of the number of milliseconds.

If Pygame is built without full image support, :class:`sge.Sprite` will
only be able to load uncompressed BMP images.

The pygame.mixer module, which is used for all audio playback, is
optional and depends on SDL_mixer; if pygame.mixer is unavailable,
sounds and music will not play.

On some systems, :class:`sge.Music` attempting to load an unsupported
format can crash the game.  Since MP3 support is limited, it is best to
avoid using it; consider using Ogg Vorbis instead.

Missing Features
----------------

:meth:`sge.Sprite.draw_line`, :meth:`sge.Room.project_line`, and
:meth:`sge.Game.project_line` support anti-aliasing for lines with a
thickness of 1 only.  :meth:`sge.Sprite.draw_polygon`,
:meth:`sge.Room.project_polygon`, and :meth:`sge.Game.project_polygon`
support anti-aliasing for outlines of polygons with a thickness of 1
only.  :meth:`sge.Sprite.draw_text`, :meth:`sge.Room.project_text`,
and :meth:`sge.Game.project_text` support anti-aliasing in all cases.
No other drawing or projecting methods support anti-aliasing.

Known Problems
--------------

There is a bug in either Pygame or SDL, most likely SDL, which sometimes
causes keyboard input to stop working.  In Pygame programs such as this
one, this occurs when pygame.display.set_mode is called multiple times,
which in the Pygame SGE occurs any time either the size of the window or
the video mode (windowed or fullscreen) changes.  See this post from the
SGE blog for more information:

https://savannah.nongnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=8113

You may also be interested in this report on the Pygame issue tracker:

https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/issue/212/

As mentioned in the post on the SGE blog, this is a particularly serious
problem for anyone using the X Window System (e.g. pretty much any
GNU/Linux user), or any other window system that gives complete control
to fullscreen SDL applications.  On these systems, if the game requires
keyboard input to either leave fullscreen or exit, the system will
become unresponsive to everything that isn't sent directly to the kernel
(such as the magic SysRq key in Linux systems).

Luckily, the bug doesn't seem to affect mouse input, so if you allow the
player to enter fullscreen mode in-game, it is highly recommended for
you to provide some method of either exiting the game or exiting
fullscreen with the mouse.  This can be a button somewhere on the screen
if the game uses the mouse cursor, or it can be a simple mouse button
click otherwise.
